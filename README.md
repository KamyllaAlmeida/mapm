# Mapm
Mapm is a map making app that allows users to create and moderate curated lists of geographical data points. Think Wikipedia for maps.

## Demo

- Authorized users are able to make new maps and edit any current maps that exist on the server.
- App name, title and image can be entered for displaying the map in lists.
- To add a new point simply type the name or address of the location.
- The map expands as new points are added.
- To delete a point, find the point in the list and click 'Delete'.
- The map will remove the point and redraw the new bounds.

## Roadmap

Mapm was a five day project, but we would like to expand on it when time permits. Some of the features we've considered implementing:

1. Full login and authorization - Currently we have a dummy login system with only a couple pre-programmed users.
2. Moderation system - Like Wikipedia, our app is open to editing by any registered user. To prevent abuse and misuse of the app, would require a moderation system.
3. Featured maps - If something is in the headlines, a relevant map on the front page would be useful.
